			<p>My strengths are hard-working, a good learner, self-motivated.
My weakness is, I am a little bit shy and easily trust anyone and speaking English a little bit poorly. But I can improve it as soon as possible.
Coming to my hobbies, My Hobbies are playing cooking, watching motivational videos, spending time with my friends, families and I like exploring things.
Now, as a fresher, I am waiting for an opportunity to upgrade my skills and also eagerly waiting to explore new technologies.
